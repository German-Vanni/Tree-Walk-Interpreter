# Nox language

This repository is the home of the Nox language.
Nox will be the result of following Robert Nystrom's [Crafting interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) , changing some things here and there.
So, Nox scripting language will be heavily based on **Lox** (the language that the book creates).
This language is only a for-fun project.. *it shall never be used in the real world*(for now).

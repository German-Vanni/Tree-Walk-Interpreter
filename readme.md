# Lox language

This repository is one of the many homes of the Lox language, implemented in Java and the result of following Robert Nystrom's [Crafting interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) (changing some things here and there).

This is only a for-fun and for-learning project... *it shall never be used in the real world* (for now).
